## Progress — MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Builder

### Overall Status

Early project setup; core spec defined in `PID.md` and Memory Bank initialized.

### Completed

- [x] Capture high-level product and technical requirements from `PID.md`.
- [x] Create Memory Bank core files:
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `activeContext.md`
  - `progress.md`

### In Progress

- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation
  - [ ] Next.js project setup with MUI theme
  - [ ] ReactFlow canvas with basic node rendering
  - [ ] Stage library with drag-and-drop (scaffold/placeholder)
  - [ ] Basic node connection logic (minimal wiring)

### Not Started

- [ ] Phase 2: Stage Configuration
- [ ] Phase 3: Execution Engine
- [ ] Phase 4: Advanced Stages
- [ ] Phase 5: Polish (Code export, sample data seeding, responsive tweaks, documentation)

### Known Issues / Risks

- Need to ensure MongoDB Atlas configuration is easy to set up locally via `.env.local`.
- ReactFlow and MUI integration should be checked for styling conflicts (z-index, layout).
